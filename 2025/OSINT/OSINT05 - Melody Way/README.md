## Hints

1. The cube has many names.
2. Notice the capitalization in the example flag.
3. While playing CTFs and creating the flag, use _ only to replace spaces. All of the other characters usually stay the same.
4. Keep it simple. Don't look at one point but at all of the complex.
5. [Thread with image](https://ghosttown.deadface.io/t/who-the-hell-is-tilon-flosk/82/8 "‌")
6.

7. In the image, in the back, we can see bus 600. [That’s its route](https://trello.com/1/cards/68e0d436d78a4f612ab553e8/attachments/68e3611b85a75869e37e3c6f/download/image.png "‌").

## Solution

Reverse-searching the image reveals a Korean article that includes the exact address.
In case one couldn’t find the article it is possible to cross reference between the location of the “Paris Baguette” (the sign writen in Korean on the left) along with the bus number in front (600).

The answer is the name of the building in front.
