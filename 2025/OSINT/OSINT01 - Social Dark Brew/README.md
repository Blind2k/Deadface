## Challenge

> To reach his high-value target, Mirveal must infiltrate a shadowy coffee house as part of a watering hole attack. His first step? Gaining access without raising suspicion. How could he get inside and run his malicious acts?

## Hints

1. The forum has one thread that the name of the coffee house is explicitly written.

## Solution

The flag will be in the Coffee house Instagram page that [recruits a barista](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNA3Q5ZMFig/ "‌").

The image alt text contain the flag.
