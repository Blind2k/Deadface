# Deadface
All of the challenges I made to DEADFACE CTF. Have fun and keep it legal :)

Challenges are organized by category:
- /web/        â†’ Web exploitation challenges (XSS, SQLi, etc.)
- /pwn/        â†’ Binary exploitation & memory-safety challenges
- /reverse/    â†’ Reverse engineering puzzles
- /crypto/     â†’ Cryptography challenges
- /forensics/  â†’ Log analysis, PCAPs, disk images, etc.
- /misc/       â†’ Everything else that doesn't fit neatly above
- /writeups/   â†’ Official walkthroughs (released after CTF)

Each challenge directory includes:
- Docker compose, Source code or artifacts to deploy/play the challenge
- A README explaining the goal & deployment instructions

## ðŸš€ How to Run a Challenge

Web and SQL challenges support Docker for quick deployment:
```bash
cd web/<challenge_name>
docker compose up --build
```
Look at the .env file for ports.
