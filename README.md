# Deadface
All of the challenges I made to DEADFACE CTF. Have fun and keep it legal :)

Challenges are organized by category:
- /Web/            â†’ Web exploitation
- /OSINT/          â†’ Photos and images
- /Steganography/  â†’ Hidden messages
- /DBs/            â†’ DB exploitation (SQL/NoSQL)


Each challenge directory includes:
- Docker compose, Source code or artifacts to deploy/play the challenge
- A README explaining the goal & deployment instructions

## ðŸš€ How to Run a Challenge

Web and SQL challenges support Docker for quick deployment:
```bash
cd web/<challenge_name>
docker compose up --build
```
Look at the .env file for ports.
